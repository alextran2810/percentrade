# URL Restructure Summary
**Date:** October 24, 2025

## What Was Changed

### 1. Folder Structure (Clean URLs)
All content pages moved from `page.html` to `page/index.html`:

- `/about/index.html` → `https://percentrade.com/about/`
- `/contact/index.html` → `https://percentrade.com/contact/`
- `/roulette-statistics/index.html` → `https://percentrade.com/roulette-statistics/`
- `/privacy-policy/index.html` → `https://percentrade.com/privacy-policy/`
- `/terms-of-use/index.html` → `https://percentrade.com/terms-of-use/`
- `/sms-opt-in-policy/index.html` → `https://percentrade.com/sms-opt-in-policy/`

Root files unchanged:
- `/index.html` → `https://percentrade.com/` (intro/loading page)
- `/home.html` → `https://percentrade.com/home.html` (main homepage)

### 2. Canonical Tags Added
Every page now has a canonical tag pointing to the clean URL with trailing slash:
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://percentrade.com/page/">
```

### 3. Redirect Files Created
Legacy `.html` URLs now redirect to clean URLs via meta refresh:
- `about.html` → redirects to `/about/`
- `contact.html` → redirects to `/contact/`
- `roulette-statistics.html` → redirects to `/roulette-statistics/`
- `privacy-policy.html` → redirects to `/privacy-policy/`
- `terms-of-use.html` → redirects to `/terms-of-use/`
- `sms-opt-in-policy.html` → redirects to `/sms-opt-in-policy/`

### 4. Internal Links Updated
All navigation, footer, and content links now use clean URLs with trailing slashes:
- `href="/about/"` instead of `href="about.html"`
- All asset paths made absolute: `/global.css`, `/percentrade_logo.png`

### 5. Sitemap Updated
`sitemap.xml` now lists only canonical clean URLs with trailing slashes:
- All lastmod dates updated to `2025-10-24`
- Removed `/home` entry (not needed since it's home.html at root)
- All URLs end with `/`

### 6. Robots.txt
Already correct:
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /

Sitemap: https://percentrade.com/sitemap.xml
```

## Google Search Console Next Steps

### 1. Re-Submit Sitemap
- Go to **Search Console** → **Sitemaps**
- Submit: `https://percentrade.com/sitemap.xml`
- Google will recrawl and index the new clean URLs

### 2. Request Indexing for Key Pages
- Use **URL Inspection** tool
- Enter each clean URL (with trailing slash):
  - `https://percentrade.com/`
  - `https://percentrade.com/about/`
  - `https://percentrade.com/roulette-statistics/`
  - `https://percentrade.com/privacy-policy/`
  - `https://percentrade.com/terms-of-use/`
- Click **Request Indexing** for each

### 3. Monitor Indexing Status
- Go to **Indexing** → **Pages**
- Watch for "Duplicate/Alternate" warnings to clear (may take a few days as redirects are processed)
- Old `.html` URLs should show as redirects

### 4. Subdomain (roumate.percentrade.com)
If you have a subdomain:
- Create a separate `sitemap.xml` on that subdomain
- Use clean URLs with trailing slashes there too
- Submit via GSC (or create a sitemap index referencing both)

## File Checklist
✅ Folder structure created  
✅ Files moved to `page/index.html`

✅ All internal links updated to clean URLs  
✅ `sitemap.xml` updated with clean URLs  
✅ `robots.txt` verified

## Testing
1. **Local/Staging:** Test that all links work and redirects function
2. **Deploy:** Push to GitHub Pages
3. **Wait 24-48 hours:** For Google to recrawl
4. **Check GSC:** Verify clean URLs are indexed and old .html redirects work

## Benefits
